# Sample-Code
This repository contains sample code mostly for the Raspberry Pi and Raspbian, created by meigrafd and others. The idea for this repository was posted on the german [Raspberry Pi forum](https://forum-raspberrypi.de/forum/thread/26393-samplecoderepository/). To get started with the Markdown syntax used here, see [this introduction](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

The code is written in Python, Shell and PHP, along with some additional programs written in other languages.

**Please note that this repository is fairly new (and unordered). Feel free to clean up the structure or add useful information to the wiki. Thanks!**
